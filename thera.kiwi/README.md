# Thera.Kiwi

Thera.Kiwi is the landing page for a web application designed to enhance online therapy sessions. It provides a shared visual space where therapists and clients can interact using digital card decks, aiming to bring the richness of in-person therapeutic tools to a remote setting.

## About The Project

While video conferencing has made remote therapy widely accessible, it can lack the tangible, interactive elements of face-to-face sessions. Tools like images, figurines, and cards that facilitate creative communication and symbolic exploration are often missing from standard video calls.

Thera.Kiwi addresses this gap by providing a platform centered on digital cards. It allows therapists and clients to engage in a dynamic, shared workspace, enriching online sessions with analogical communication, imagination, metaphorical play, and creative expression.

## Key Features

**Shared Visual Workspace**: A synchronized environment where therapists and clients can interact with virtual cards in real-time.

**Session Management**: Users can create meetings, send private links to clients, and save session progress to continue later.

**Customizable Card Decks**: Select from a library of pre-made, royalty-free card decks or upload your own physical cards to use in the digital space.

**Interactive Session Controls**: Therapists can configure the session by displaying cards face up or down, allowing clients to scroll, choose, arrange, annotate, and move cards between private and shared areas.

**Flexible Pricing Tiers**: The service is presented with multiple subscription plans (Standard, Premium, Gold) with both monthly and yearly billing options.

## Target Audience

This platform is intended for a variety of professionals, including:

- Psychotherapists
- Psychologists
- Counselors
- Coaches
- Tarotists

## Technical Stack

**Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

**Libraries**: jQuery, SmoothScroll.js

**Assets**: Locally-hosted Nunito web fonts and SVG images.
